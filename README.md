# Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the **Tata Data Visualization Job Simulation** on Forage (April 2025). In this simulation, I served as a consultant for an online 
retail store, analyzing their sales data and delivering actionable insights to the CEO and CMO for strategic planning and business expansion.

## Data Source

All retail transaction data analyzed in this project was provided by Forage as part of the Tata Data Visualization Virtual Experience Program. The dataset is synthetic and used strictly for educational purposes.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Framing Business Questions

I developed data-driven business questions tailored to the strategic goals of both the CEO and CMO.

#### Questions for the CEO (Strategy & Growth)
1. **Top-performing product categories, revenue/profit contribution, and seasonal patterns**  
   Identify revenue drivers and trends to inform product focus, inventory planning, and resource allocation.

2. **Revenue by country and market growth trajectories**  
   Determine priority countries for international expansion based on performance and potential.

3. **Customer purchase frequency and average order value across segments**  
   Understand customer lifetime value to guide retention and marketing spend.

4. **Seasonal trends, inventory planning, and marketing timing**  
   Optimize inventory, staffing, and cash flow using seasonality insights.

#### Questions for the CMO (Marketing & Customer Insights)
1. **Products with highest customer demand and popularity drivers**  
   Guide marketing campaigns and product positioning.

2. **Customer engagement and retention by country**  
   Tailor regional marketing strategies for better retention.

3. **Products with highest repeat purchase rates**  
   Strengthen loyalty programs and upselling strategies.

4. **Pricing impact on sales and optimal price ranges**  
   Evaluate pricing elasticity to boost revenue and brand positioning.

### Task 2: Data Visualization Implementation (Power BI)

I used **Power BI** to create four targeted visualizations aligned with executive decision-making:

1. **Monthly Revenue Time Series (2011)**  
   Line chart showing seasonal revenue trends to support forecasting.

### Data Preparation Process

Before visualization, I cleaned the dataset to ensure integrity:
- Removed records with negative quantities (returns)
- Excluded entries with unit prices below $0
- Applied conditional formulas and transformations to prepare for analysis

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** – for all data visualizations
- **Power Query** – for initial data cleaning and transformation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Business requirements gathering  
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Strategic analysis & executive storytelling  
- Dashboard design using Power BI  
- Visualizing business KPIs & trends  
- Customer segmentation & market targeting

## Project Outcome
The final dashboards provided strategic insights into:
- Profitable product categories  
- High-growth international markets  
- Customer behavior and retention opportunities  
- Seasonality trends to guide operations

These insights help the executive team optimize marketing, improve customer targeting, and plan international expansion more effectively.
